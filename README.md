# Star Wars: The Last Battle 

A cli text adventure game written in Java, inspired by Star Wars 

## About

This fun little project was inspired by my favourite movie of all time, **Star Wars**. 

It is also a semestral project for the Java class (4IT101) at the Prague School of Economics in 2018. 

## Get started

1. Make sure you have Java Runtime Environment installed
    1. check simply by entering ``java -version`` in the command line 
        1. If nothing is found download Java [here](https://java.com/en/download/)
1. Open the command line and navigate to the directory where _StarWars.jar_ is located.
1. Run command ``java -jar StarWars.jar``
1. Enjoy the game and may the force be with you, always!

## How to play

The game starts with a greeting message and intro.

Afterwards an interface with current game statistics will appear and it will look something like the following.
![User Interface beginning](/UserInterface.png)

You will be prompted to choose a ship.

You can do so by typing the corresponding number, confirming with the ``enter`` key.

The rest of the game develops in the same fashion.

### Hints and exit

Should you be desperate for help, you can always type ``h`` for Hint.
Otherwise if you get too frustrated you can always type ``e`` to exit the game immediately. 

Have Fun!

## For cheaters

If you got the congratulations screen, great job!
If you gave up, however, then shame on you!

Follow this series of actions respectively. That should guarantee you the fastest way to win the game.
